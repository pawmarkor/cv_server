       {junior python developer}

\begin{abstract_pk}
I am a Python developer with one year of experience. Because of my physics backgorund I like math theories especially grpah theory and data mining. Personally I am a sport oriented outgoing guy and team player.

    {Warsaw, Poland}
    {\textit{Junior Python Developer}\\
    I'm a member of a team working on a payment backend application. Most of my tasks are app's logging stack (Sentry, Fluent) maintenance and refactoring small parts of the Pyramid application. While working in Daftcode I learned basics of Pyramid and Celery.}

    {\href{https://evojam.com/}{Evojam sp. z o.o.}}
    {Warsaw, Poland}
    {\textit{Junior Python Developer}\\
    I was a backend python developer working on the outsourced project matching companies looking for services with service providers. I was responsible for maintaining, bugfixnig and developing REST based microservices. While working in Evojam I learned GraphQL, DataLoader, JS and Node.js basics. My main activity was supporting the frontend team. I had an opportunity to play with NoSQL databases (redis, elasticsearch). The main task I finished was migrating the project from REST to GraphQL.}

    {\href{http://www.syncron.com/}{Syncron Poland sp. z o.o.}}
    {Warsaw, Poland}
    {\textit{Application Specialist}\\
    As a member of Software Automation team I was developing tools for internal use. My work was focused on Syncron's products monitoring, automation of AWS servers management and data application input integration using ETL tool Talend. I've created a CherryPy based web application for log analysis and crawlers frequently inserting database statistics and daily summaries into Confluence. While working in Syncron I learned Ansible and I realized that taking care of small things is very important.}
